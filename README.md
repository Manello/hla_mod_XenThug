# [MOD] Half Life: Alyx - XenThug - 0.28
A Half Life: Alyx Mod including a classic horde defense gamemode!

You can find the latest Map **Warehouse** featuring a stable release of my Mod right here! Convince yourself and have a look at the **Trailer**! LINK TRAILER HERE

In order to play the map you have to download the XenThug-Warehouse-0.28.zip LINK IT HERE and paste it's content into your "steamapps/Half-Life Alyx/game/hlvr" folder.

After this step you will need to add the launch option "+map warehouse" to your Half-Life: Alyx in the steam library. That's all needed! Now go ahead and startup your game, it will load XenThug automatically.
If you want to play the normal campaign again simply remove the launch option you've added in Steam.

Here is a list of the currently available maps:

- **Warehouse:** The first fully functional Map featuring the XenThug Gamemode. Fight against crabs, zombies, combines and many more in an atmospheric environment! You can download the map Here LINK MAP DOWNLOAD OR STEAMPAGE.

- **Demos:** These maps have been proof-of-concepts in the past and do not offer a real gameplay experience.

- **Your Map?:** You want to create your own map using this Mod? Sure! Go ahead and let me know about it so you can get started :)
