### [FOR MAPPERS, Version 0.47]
Please refer to this new readme for mappers: [README_MAPPERS](https://github.com/Manello/hla_mod_XenThug/blob/master/README_MAPPERS.md)

NOTE: The map Warehouse does not always contain the most up-to-date scripts, thus you want to download the scripts folder directly from this repository!
