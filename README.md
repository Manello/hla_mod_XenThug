# [MOD] Half Life: Alyx - XenThug
A Half Life: Alyx Mod including a classic wave defense gamemode

It is currently work in progress and will receive frequent updates. 
Right now the mod supports:
- Spawning different kind of waves, respawning new enemies when nobody is alive anymore
- Drops polymer as a currency on the death of an enemy (now with configurable drop chance)
- Has vending machines at which the player can buy any item defined by the mapper for polymer
- Endless mode, if all map-defined waves got spawned it starts over again, but doubles the enemies life each time!
- Basic sound events
- Configurable Delays
- Portable to any map without a ton of work!

Here is a list of the currently available maps:

- **Test map:** This map is simply a proof of concept and is contained in the xenthugdemo.zip! To play the map simply place the content of this zip file inside your Half-Life Alyx/game/hlvr folder, and in steam add a "+map xenthugdemo" startup parameter to Half Life:Alyx! (And no, it will not break your game, simply remove the startup parameter to play the normal game again)
